# How to create a new card

I use Card Conjurer to create all cards. It's a website that runs a client-side browser application that supports limited templating and customization of card designs. https://cardconjurer.com/creator

## Card Conjurer Templates
I've created several templates that can be used with Card Conjurer.
- Item
- Rune
- Spell Effect
- Spell
- Creature Statblock

### Loading a template
1. Go to the [Card Conjurer creator|https://cardconjurer.com/creator]
1. Select the "Frames" tab
1. Drag your chosen template to the box that says "Drag your template here" 
This will load the chosen template into the creator and you can then proceed to filling in the card details

## Card Details
With a blank template loaded, you can now fill in the details for your card. Templates have pre-defined text boxes with labels for what should go in each box. They also have pre-defined locations for images.

### Filling in text details
1. Switch to the "Text" tab
1. Fill in content for each text box if applicable
1. It is often necessary to adjust the size and positioning of a text box to accommodate large blocks of text (multiline, positioning, length, width, etc.)

### Choosing a card image
1. Switch to the "Images" tab
1. Find an appropriate image in the available stock images
1. Drag the image to the box that says "Drag your image here"
1. If the image doesn't appear, switch to the "Frames" tab and drag the "Item Art" layer up one spot
1. Switch back to the "Images" tab
1. Expand the "More Options" section below the image you added
1. Play with the position, size, and rotation values until the image is reasonably sized and centered

### Exporting a card
1. Ensure you are satisfied with the card preview
1. Scroll down and select "Save Image" to export the PNG image to your computer
1. Select "Save JSON" to export the machine-readable version of your card

### Uploading cards back to Github
1. Create a PR with all of the JSON card exports in their appropriate folders
1. Do not include the rendered PNG files (the .gitignore should ignore them)
