While wearing the talisman as an action, one can choose to rub the coin during a haggling situation that requires a persuasion check. The coin, once used, dissolves into a fine golden dust. As the coin dissolves, the negotiator immediately succeeds on their check to obtain the item in question at a discount of up to 25%. However, for the next 1d4 sessions, any persuasion checks to obtain discounts elsewhere are made at disadvantage, as word has traveled of your uncanny haggling abilities. The coin, once used, dissolves into a fine golden dust.\nThe talisman can only be used on trade goods that are selling for full price, and that are selling for money.
