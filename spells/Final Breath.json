On a hit, the creature takes 5d6 necrotic damage. If the creature is below full health, it takes 5d8 necrotic damage instead. If the creature is below half health, they take 5d10 necrotic damage instead. \nIf this damage reduces the target creature to zero hit points, they immediately transform into a zombie under your command. During your turn, if the zombie is within 60 feet, you can use your bonus action to command it to take an action and move. If not given a command, the zombie will take the dodge action at the end of your turn. This zombie remains for one minute or until you lose concentration, at which point it collapses to the ground as a corpse.
